my AZ-900 exam feedback

Excited to share that I’ve successfully cleared the AZ-900 certification — Microsoft’s entry-level exam that validates your foundational understanding of Azure cloud concepts, services, pricing, and governance.

If you're just starting your cloud journey — this is the perfect place to begin.


📚 How I Prepared:

✔️ Microsoft Learn AZ-900 Path – easy to follow, well-structured
✔️ Free YouTube crash courses (exam-focused walkthroughs)
✔️ Microsoft Docs – especially for pricing calculator, SLA, compliance, regions
✔️ Skillcertpro AZ-900 Practice Tests – ✅ the best decision I made

The Skillcertpro practice exams were spot on — about 70–80% of my real exam questions were similar in tone, structure, or logic. They helped me understand not just the right answer, but why it’s right.

🔍 What Appeared on the Actual AZ-900 Exam (June 2024):

• Cloud concepts (IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS, CapEx vs OpEx) — expect 3–4 direct questions
• Scenario-based questions comparing services: VMs vs Containers, Azure SQL vs Cosmos DB
• Pricing and SLA-based questions — calculate cost-effective solutions
• Management tools – Azure Portal, Cloud Shell, ARM Templates, Azure Advisor
• Compliance topics like MS Trust Center, Azure Policy, Blueprints, RBAC vs ABAC
• Understand regions, availability zones, and resource groups
• Features of key services like VMs, Storage Accounts, VNets, Azure Functions
• Security services – Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, Microsoft Entra (Azure AD), MFA
• You will see multiple real-world scenarios — e.g., which service to choose for specific needs

Note: Very little memorization is needed, but understanding how to compare services in real scenarios is essential.

🎯 Key Topics to Know:

🔹 Cloud Concepts – Public/Private/Hybrid, SaaS vs IaaS vs PaaS, high availability, DR
🔹 Core Azure Services – Compute, Storage, Networking, Databases, AI/ML basics
🔹 Pricing & Support – Azure Calculator, TCO, SLA, subscriptions, cost mgmt
🔹 Security & Identity – Entra ID (Azure AD), RBAC, Key Vault, Compliance tools
🔹 Governance & Monitoring – Azure Policy, Management Groups, Azure Monitor

🧠 Tips for Success:

• Focus on service purpose and comparison, not just definitions
• Know the pricing model, SLA guarantees, and how Azure billing works
• Practice with Skillcertpro mock tests — go through each explanation
• Use the Azure Portal if possible, even with a free account — it helps connect the dots
• Revisit topics like identity management, regions/zones, and cost optimization

🙌 Final Thoughts:

The AZ-900 is short (~40–60 questions in 45 mins) but tests your real understanding, especially in service selection and cost/governance strategy.

If you're preparing — use realistic practice questions like those from Skillcertpro, focus on scenarios, not just terms, and go in with confidence. You'll be glad you started your Azure journey here.
